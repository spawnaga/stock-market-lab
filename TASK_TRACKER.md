# Stock Market Lab - Task Tracker

## Current Status

This task tracker reflects the implementation progress of the AI-Driven Multi-Agent Stock Market Lab project based on the roadmap in SUMMARY.md.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] C++ Backend with WebSocket server for real-time market data streaming
- [x] Python Agents framework with RL, LSTM, and News/NLP agents
- [x] React/TypeScript Frontend dashboard with real-time charts and agent displays
- [x] Database and Redis configurations for data storage and caching
- [x] Docker orchestration with docker-compose for service management
- [x] Strategy Lab: Natural language interface for strategy creation

## In Progress Tasks

- [x] Real Data Integration: Connect to Polygon, Tradier, or Schwab APIs
- [x] Enhanced Human-AI Collaboration: Guardrails and override mechanisms
- [ ] GPU Acceleration: Rust microservice for order book simulations
- [ ] Production Features: Security, monitoring, and scalability improvements

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **GPU Acceleration** - Develop Rust microservice for order book simulations
2. **Production Features** - Add security, monitoring, and scalability enhancements

## Implementation Notes

The Strategy Lab feature has been successfully implemented with:
- Natural language interface for strategy creation
- Parameter configuration for different strategy types
- Real-time strategy management and display
- Integration with existing agent system
- Responsive frontend design

This implementation fulfills the "Advanced Strategy Lab: Natural language interface for strategy creation" requirement from the roadmap.
