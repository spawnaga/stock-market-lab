2. The backend validates and formats the data
3. Data is cached in Redis for fast access
4. Python agents poll Redis for new data updates
5. All agents process the data simultaneously

### 2. Real-Time Processing Pipeline
```
Data Ingestion → Agent Processing → Decision Making → Action Execution
```

**Detailed Flow**:
1. **Data Reception**: Agents receive OHLCV data through WebSocket connections
2. **Feature Engineering**: Raw data is transformed into meaningful features
3. **Analysis**: Each agent applies its specialized algorithms
4. **Decision Generation**: Agents produce actionable insights
5. **Aggregation**: Multiple agent decisions are combined
6. **Action Execution**: Trading decisions are sent to the broker

### 3. Sentiment Data Integration
```
News Sources → NLP Processing → Sentiment Scoring → Agent Integration
```

**Process**:
1. News articles and social media posts are collected from various sources
2. Text preprocessing removes noise and standardizes format
3. Transformer models analyze sentiment with confidence scoring
4. Sentiment scores are weighted based on source credibility
5. Scores are integrated into trading decisions and risk assessments
