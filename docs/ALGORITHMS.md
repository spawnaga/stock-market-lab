# Algorithms and Technical Approaches in the AI-Driven Multi-Agent Stock Market Lab

This document details the sophisticated algorithms and mathematical approaches that power the AI-Driven Multi-Agent Stock Market Lab, explaining how each agent utilizes specific methodologies to deliver superior market analysis and trading capabilities.

## 1. Reinforcement Learning Agent Algorithms

### Q-Learning with Neural Networks (Deep Q-Network - DQN)

**Core Algorithm**: 
The RL agent employs a Deep Q-Network that combines traditional Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle the high-dimensional state space of financial markets.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
Q*(s,a) = max_a' [R(s,a) + γ * max_a'' Q*(s',a'')]
```

Where:
- Q*(s,a) = Optimal action-value function
- R(s,a) = Reward for taking action a in state s
- γ = Discount factor (0.95-0.99)
- s' = Next state after taking action a

**Implementation Details**:
- **State Representation**: Technical indicators, price ratios, volume metrics, sentiment scores
- **Action Space**: BUY, SELL, HOLD with varying position sizes
- **Reward Function**: 
  ```
  Reward = (Profit/Loss) + (Risk Adjustment) + (Sentiment Alignment)
  ```

2. **Input Gate**: Determines what new information to store
3. **Output Gate**: Controls what information to output

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)  // Forget gate
i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)  // Input gate  
o_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)  // Output gate
```

Fraction = (bp - q) / b
```

Where:
- b = Net odds received on the bet
- p = Probability of winning
- q = Probability of losing = 1 - p

**Dynamic Position Sizing**:
```
Position_Size = Base_Position × (1 + Risk_Adjustment × Volatility_Factor)
```

### Stop-Loss Optimization
